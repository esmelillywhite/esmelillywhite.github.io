# **Welcome ** 

<br> <br>
I am a doctoral candidate with the [Inspiring Children's Futures](https://inspiringchildrensfutures.org/) Doctoral Research Centre, University of Strathclyde in Scotland. My research looks at the role of education in intergenerational income mobility in the UK. 

My research interests include quantitative methods, social stratification and inequality and education.
